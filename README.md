# BankyBanking
Building a banking app using UIKit programmatically. 
Lessons and challenges taken from The Swift Arcade profesional iOS development course by jrasmusson.

I built this app / took this course a means to become better at UIKit. 
I had previously completed AngelaYu's UIKit course, but it did not cover programmatic UI nor nibs.
This course covered both of those topics so I decided to challenge myself and take on the course. 

**What I learned building this app**

- Setting up XCode for programmatic UI (Also made AppDelegate code snippets)
- Building Views programmatically. (Initializing Views, addSubView(), and NSLayoutConstraint.activate()) 
- Onboarding using UIPageViewController.
- Programmatic UITableView with MVVM architecture. Also learnt how to add a header to the tables(The header used a nib)
- Delegate/Protocols vs Observers (Which to use in certain situations).
- All data is taken from networking using URLSession and the Result type.
- Animations (simple contraint animations and more complex animations like key frame animations).
- how to use git in the terminal (git add, commit, squash, rebase, merge, pull, push, status, diff, log)
